### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

    In this meetup we welcome students, teachers and business representatives who are open to support students and will introduce them to the concept of Blockchain; “what is Blockchain and why is everyone talking about it”? Next to this explanation some use cases will be shared. The audience will be a good mix of students and teachers from different backgrounds, such as Software Development, Business, Entrepreneurship and Logistics. Also some startups are invited.

    Apart from the introductory lecture about Blockchain, you can also join a workshop "Blockchain for business without code", where you can create smart contracts and learn to work with a toolset that can integrate different Blockchains into any IT-system, without using a single line of code.

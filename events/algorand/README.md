description: Algorand Amsterdam Meetup - Unlocking a global, borderless economy
name: Algorand Amsterdam Meetup

synopsis:
  - Join Algorand for drinks and a discussion around the next-gen blockchain technology that's creating a truly global, borderless economy.
  - Blockchain technology promised a fairer world, where value could be shared freely across all borders, in a transparent and secure manner, excluding no one.
  - However, immature technology, currency volatility and the complexity and cost of blockchain technology have been hindering the large scale adoption of blockchain.
  - We invite businesses, developers and blockchain enthusiasts to join us for a night of drinks, networking and discussion on how Algorand is now leading the way in fulfilling blockchain's promise.
  - Algorand’s blockchain platform creates full transparency, protection and speed within a truly decentralized network. It achieves velocity on par with large payment and financial networks while securely scaling to billions of users. Algorand’s pure proof-of-stake approach is the first of its kind to provide immediate transaction finality without forking.
  - Admissions is free, but space is limited so make sure to get your ticket!
  - The lineup will be announced as soon as possible.

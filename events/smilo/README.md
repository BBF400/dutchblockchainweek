synopsis:
  - We start with a tech-friendly talk about decentralised blockchains, permissioned blockchains and hybrid blockchains. When the differences are clear we will reveal the importance of decentralisation and Identities.
  - There are many blockchain flavours out there. Smilo will explain the basics and how to choose for the correct implementation. Will it be decentralised? Permissioned? or maybe event hybrid?
  - With great technology we can do great things. Decentralised Identifiers is just one thing. We will explain the basics of decentralised Identifiers and the possibilities it will give.
  - We will end the evening with a network session and table talks. Share knowledge and experiences while enjoying a snack and a drink.

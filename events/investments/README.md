### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

    bio: I studied political philosophy and history at the University of Auckland. Shortly afterwards I emigrated from New Zealand to the Netherlands in 2013. During this time I discovered cryptocurrencies in which I immersed myself more and more. This led to investing and trading in cryptocurrencies and the creation of a bitcoin mining operation in 2014.
    Nowadays, I devote myself full time to cryptocurrencies, doing fundamental analysis with a focus on the underlying governance models. Cryptocurrencies require a multidisciplinary approach to understand them, but also to successfully invest in them. I expect this new technology to become more widely adopted, with capital investments making a real contribution to building the infrastructure needed for such greater mass adoption.

synopsis:
  - As new models for digital assets and tokenization arise there are still a lot of questions about which token models are preffered. How token models of both blockchain projects and funds can be evaluated and how they are valued. Finally, the biggest question of all is how to deal with regulation. In this meetup we will hear about two different approaches to tokenization and have an indepth discussion about the role and approach of regulation in this field.
  - We will start with a presentation by Gys Hough from Coinstone capital about his view on tokenization, the purpose of utility tokens and his picture of the future for the Coinstone fund. In the second presentation that we will hear about the other model, security tokens. After introducing these two views we will invite various experts with backgrounds in investments, regulation and compliance as well as cryptofunds to talk about regulation, its purpose and current state.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
####################
# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:
  - As new models for digital assets and tokenization arise there are still a lot of questions about which token models are preffered. How token models of both blockchain projects and funds can be evaluated and how they are valued. Finally, the biggest question of all is how to deal with regulation. In this meetup we will hear about two different approaches to tokenization and have an indepth discussion about the role and approach of regulation in this field.
  - We will start with a presentation by Gys Hough from Coinstone capital about his view on tokenization, the purpose of utility tokens and his picture of the future for the Coinstone fund. In the second presentation that we will hear about the other model, security tokens. After introducing these two views we will invite various experts with backgrounds in investments, regulation and compliance as well as cryptofunds to talk about regulation, its purpose and current state.

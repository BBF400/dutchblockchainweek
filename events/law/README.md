description: DLT & the Law - current challenges, legislators trends and future opportunities
name: DLT & the Law - current challenges, legislators trends and future opportunities

synopsis:
  - We need new laws they say, but do we really need them to keep moving? From the GDPR apparent clash with blockchain’s immutability, to the question of ownership of a self-sovereign ledgers, to the question of enforceability of smart contracts, do we really need the legislators’ intervention or can we actually work around existing laws in order to keep building disruptive technologies? With a positive mindset aiming at finding solutions to foster tech innovation for the benefit of society, Alessandro Mazzi will guide you through some of the legal challenges blockchain is currently facing, and what he believes are the most interesting opportunities the law could offer to blockchain entrepreneurs in the future.

Dutch Blockchain week is a community driven organization of an unofficial blockchain week during the Money2020 conference and as part of the Fintech Week (organized by HollandFintech). Existing meetup organizers and other volunteers from the Blockchain Netherlands co-organize a series of events explaining blockchain technology application and highlighting the Dutch Blockchain Ecosystem.

Our concept is simple: keep it educational, try to be as cost friendly for the
community as you can (bearing in mind, we all need to pay bills - so not all
events are free!) and to create a welcoming environment, so interested parties
at any knowledge level feel comfortable to join.

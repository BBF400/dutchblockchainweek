Using the momentum of the Money2020 conference and the incredible amount of people coming to Amsterdam, we are organizing the first Dutch Blockchain Week this year from the 2nd until 7th of June! 

Existing local meetup organizers and other volunteers from the Blockchain Netherlands network co-organize a series of events explaining blockchain technology application and highlighting the Dutch Blockchain Ecosystem. In other words, this week is completely community driven, and will host a variety of events that will showcase the Dutch Blockchain Ecosystem and attract high profile international speakers as well. We are all about bringing communities together! 

If you don’t want to miss these special events, from meetups to workshops and fireside chats, make sure to pre-register and receive new events and tickets in your inbox first. 

If you want to contribute to Blockchain Week, you can register your own events. Our concept is simple: keep it educational, try to be as cost friendly for the community as you can (bearing in mind, we all need to pay bills - so not all events are free!) and create a welcoming environment, so interested parties at any knowledge level feel comfortable to join.
